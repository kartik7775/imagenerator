# imagenerator

imagenerator is a Full-Stack application that allows user to create AI powered images by writing prompts. The app uses OpenAI API and creates images using integrated DALL-E system.
imagenerator provides a very simplistic design where user can create downloadable images using randomly generated prompts or using their own imagination in the prompts. Later, the images can be shared with the community.
